<p>Yo, I’m known as Swift_showcase on most platforms and this is my webpage. I collect figures as a hobby but I mix in my true passion of Media Production to my page. I aspire to be a well know media producer and I keep up on my skills by taking dynamic and intricate photos of my figures. I’m currently 21 years old and I am attending college but I’m looking to do more. I hope that my figure accounts will help push me further into my passion and help catapult me into the real world of finding a job
	<br><br>
	I started collecting in 2014 due to seeing a favorite character of mine in a unique colour style. While I wouldn’t get that figure until 8 years later it introduced me into this whole new world. Originally I collected them because I liked them, but slowly my passion for media production came about and I figured I would combine the two. While swift showcase didn’t start immediately it came shortly after. Thanks to the support from the community and being fortunate enough to collect this figures I’ve made some amazing friends and have quite a respectable account.
	<br><br>
I originally gained my inspiration for both interests through a YouTuber that goes by Ross O’Donavan. I actually credit him in a few posts. He showed off some figures in 2014 on YouTube and I really wanted them. He was a huge influence in my youth.
